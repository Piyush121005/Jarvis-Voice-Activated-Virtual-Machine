Jarvis: Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant
Jarvis is a voice-activated virtual assistant that can perform tasks like opening websites, playing music, fetching news, and handling general queries using Hugging Face's GPT-Neo model.

Features
Open popular websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
Play songs from a predefined music library.
Fetch the latest news headlines.
Generate intelligent responses for general queries using Hugging Face GPT-Neo.
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or above installed on your system.
Internet connection (required for fetching news and using Hugging Face model).
A compatible microphone for voice commands.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvis-virtual-assistant.git
cd jarvis-virtual-assistant
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install Required Libraries
Install the following libraries manually using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install requests
pip install transformers
pip install torch
Here’s what these libraries are for:

SpeechRecognition: For voice-to-text conversion.
pyttsx3: For text-to-speech functionality.
requests: For fetching news via the NewsAPI.
transformers and torch: For Hugging Face GPT-Neo text generation.
4. Set Up the News API Key
Sign up at NewsAPI to get a free API key.
Replace the placeholder API_KEY in the main.py file with your own News API key:
python
Copy code
API_KEY = "your_news_api_key_here"
5. Prepare the Music Library
Create a file called musicLibrary.py in the project folder.
Define a dictionary with song names as keys and YouTube links as values:
python
Copy code
music = {
    "song_name": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example",
    "another_song": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example2"
}
6. Run the Project
Start the virtual assistant:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Launch the project using the command above.
Speak the wake word "Hello" to activate Jarvis.
Once activated, give commands such as:
"Open Google" to open Google in a browser.
"Play song_name" to play a song from your library.
"Fetch news" to listen to the latest news headlines.
Any general query like "What is coding?" to get an AI-generated response.
Project Code Overview
main.py
This is the primary script that:

Listens for user commands via the microphone.
Processes specific commands (like opening websites, playing music, fetching news).
Uses Hugging Face GPT-Neo for intelligent responses.
musicLibrary.py
A separate file where you define a dictionary mapping song names to YouTube URLs.

Troubleshooting
Audio Issues:

Ensure your microphone is connected and not muted.
Adjust the timeout or phrase_time_limit in the sr.listen method for slower speech.
Hugging Face Warnings:

Add truncation=True and pad_token_id=50256 in the GPT-Neo generator as shown in the code to suppress warnings.
News API Errors:

Check if your News API key is valid and hasn’t exceeded the free usage limit.
Missing Libraries:

Ensure all required libraries are installed via pip.
Future Enhancements
Add integrations with other APIs (e.g., weather, calendars).
Support dynamic song addition to the music library.
Improve the natural language understanding for complex queries.
